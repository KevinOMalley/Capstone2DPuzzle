# Capstone2DPuzzle
a 2d puzzle game
# Idea: 2D puzzle platformer where we use a time travel machanic to change the layout of the levels and move/remove obsticales that are blocking paths/stopping the player from moving forward in other time periods 
# Idea: 2D puzzle game similar to slide puzzles but with protals to move pieces in other areas besides the one corner of the boards that are normally open to slide the parts of the puzzles around, maybe we can do something with color coded tiles and portals and the player has to get all the same colored pieces into their designated portal area
