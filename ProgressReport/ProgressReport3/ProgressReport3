2) Project Title and Description: Briefly describe your project

We are making a time travel-themed 2D puzzle-platformer game in C# using Unity.


3) Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment: Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed

We've added a lot to the project in order to wrap things up for the semester. We've got the levels all strung together in a sequence, a new dash mechanic, polished level designs, new sprites for the ground and walls, and checkpoints.


4) Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project, and things that went wrong during this increment

We had finals, so those somewhat got in the way of wrapping up this project. Otherwise, there were really no issues. It seems the sound design was a bit more difficult than expected, so that idea was dropped. We also had a few other ideas in the GitHub that weren't implemented because we lacked interest/ ran out of time.
