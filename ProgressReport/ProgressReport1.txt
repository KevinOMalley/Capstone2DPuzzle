2) Project Title and Description: Briefly describe your project

We are making a time travel themed 2D puzzle-platformer game in C# using unity.


3) Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment: Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed

We have basic character movement.
The Player Character Idle and walk animations are done.
Some background art has been created.
A collectabe coin design has been made.
A basic health system has been added.
The PC can wall-jump.


4) Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment

There was that hurricane that threw our schedule off a bit. We did have a bug with the player sprite falling over, but Reece took care of that. 

I had to redesign the player character a few times. The first editions are just basic designs I made using Microsoft Powerpoint, but after I wanted to make them a bit more detailed, I redesigned them using Krita. The 2nd edition sprited were better looking, and I planned to animate them using bones in unity. When I did all of that, the designs looked wierd so I redid them a 3rd time. This time I simplified the design a bit and make it easier to animate. However, this time I didn't plan to use bones but use frame by frame animation which takes a while. It looks good though lol.

6) Plans for the next increment: If this report if for the first or second increment, describe what are you planning to achieve in the next increment

I'm hoping to have a few more animations done by then, like an attack animation or an animation where a coin is floating and rotating. 
We haven't implemented a time-manipulating mechanic yet, so that's a goal. 
If I fall off of the screen, I currently just fall forever. We hope to change that before the next increment.
We will be adding the ability to interact with objects. This is so we can begin implementing a coin mechanic, or some other type of collectible.
