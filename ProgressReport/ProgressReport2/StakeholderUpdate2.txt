Dear stakeholders, 
We have great news. We’ve made a lot of progress since the last progress report. We’ve changed past mechanics like wall-jumping added new ones like a Jetpack. New obstacles like rotating buzzsaws and a maze have been made. We’ve finished the layout for a tutorial-like level. I believe all of the in-game sprites are now created by us and none are off the Unity asset store. New animations for death and damage have been added, plus you transform into a rocket when you use the jetpack. We’ve added health, jet pack battery, and respawn mechanics. I don’t believe there were many difficulties other than a bug here and there that have been handled. I will say that the workload has increased quite a bit as we’re working to have everything finished over the next few weeks. We have plans for 3 levels total, a dash mechanic, custom tile maps, enemies, and background music. This game is on track to benefit the company and its shareholders.  
Best,
The Time Travel Adventure design team
