Something that resets the stage and its objects back to their original position (maybe a weapon of some sort, time travel gun)

Some sort of combat (if we just implement dodging attacks, it would probably be simpler than full-on combat with health bars)

A pre-historic level
A midieval level
a futuristic level

using a tool to destroy an object in the way (ex. bomb from Zelda)

Something that allows the player to time travel, so each level has a futuer, pre-historic, and present version where each version opens or closes a path that would be open or closed in other versions 
Disappearing platforms 
coin like collectiables, where collecting a certain amount gives the player an extra life
each level could contain 3 unique collectibles that are harder to get to  

Maybe a battery
gadgets in the design

changing level design for the present, future, and past
