Something that resets the stage and its objects back to their original position

Some sort of combat (if we just implement dodging attacks, it would probably be simpler than full-on combat with health bars)

A pre-historic level
a futuristic level

using a tool to destroy an object in the way (ex. bomb from Zelda)
